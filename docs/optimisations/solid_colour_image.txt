Images within an image block might be a uniform colour (all pixels hold the same value).
In this case, accessing every pixel in the image data is wasteful as each pixel is the same.
In this case (when ImageBlock::LayerData::dataType == ImageBlock::LayerData::DataType::SOLID_COLOUR) the image data is not used (though the image data is still filled with the colour value so that it is ready when needed)
