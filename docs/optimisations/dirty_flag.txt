Image blocks store a 'dirty' boolean to track whether any state or image data has changed in the image block (on any layer) since the last canvas redraw.
When the canvas is redrawn, only 'dirty' image blocks are redrawn onto the canvas texture.
The entire canvas texture is then drawn to the window, regardless of how many image blocks are dirty.

A global dirty flag (canvasDirty) is stored which represents the dirty state of the entire canvas. 
This is set to true whenever any image block is made dirty.
The final canvas texture is only modified when canvasDirty is true.
