== Compiling ==

For Linux:

0. To set up Linux for c/c++ development, run 
	sudo eopkg install -c system.devel
on ubuntu run
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential

1. Install the development packages for GLFW, Freetype, zlib, and libpng
	Alternatively, modify the makefile to use the windows_include directory
	* The versions of the headers in this folder might not match the versions installed through the package manager

2. cd into the project root directory and run
	make -j9

For Windows:

0. Set up MinGW for compiling C++ or use Visual Studio (you will have to set up a project yourself)

1. Run windows_install.bat

.dll files and header files are included


** To debug with gdb on windows, run gdb ./paint
Before running the program, type 
	break abort
into the gdb console so that gdb will stop execution when an assertation fails.
